Hello! I am <b> Ovaiz Ali </b> currently pursuing my undergraduate studies from <b> FAST NUCES </b> in the field of <b> Computer Science </b>. I am an inquisitive and enthusiastic developer with leadership skills and strong foundation in mathematics, logic, problem solving and coding. In addition to it, I am learning and practicing computer science streams like <b> Data Science, Data Engineering, Machine Learning and Deep Learning </b>, and that's what I am passionate about.

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle which I want to solve. <b> Finding hiddden patterns </b> is always a challenge to me.

Beside technical stuff, I ❤️ to work within a team, recognize business/social problems to be solved , evaluate requirements, and learn from others experiences. Collectively, I am a <b> team player </b> who leads by an example and believes in achievements attained together.
